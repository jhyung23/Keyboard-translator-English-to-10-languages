        MASTER TRANSLATOR - QUICK START GUIDE
==================================================

Master Translator is a background utility that translates your 
typing in real-time. Simply type, add the trigger dots, 
and watch your text transform.

--- HOW TO TRANSLATE ---

1. GLOBAL TRANSLATION (Selects everything in the box):
   Type your text and end it with TWO dots.
   Example: This is a long paragraph..
   (The script performs a 'Select All' and replaces everything.)

--- HOTKEYS ---

[Ctrl + Alt + T]        : Enable / Disable the Translator
[Ctrl + Alt + 1-9]      : Switch Target Languages (Korean, French, etc.)
[Ctrl + Alt + 0]        : Switch Target Language to Turkish

--- SYSTEM TRAY FEATURES ---

Right-click the Blue Icon in your taskbar to:
- View the last successful translation.
- Manually select a target language.
- Toggle the "Success Sound" on or off.
- Exit the application completely.

--- PRO TIPS ---

* INACTIVITY RESET: If you stop typing for 5 seconds, the 
  internal memory wipes. This prevents old text from 
  clashing with new sentences.
* URL SAFETY: The script automatically ignores text 
  containing "www." or ".com" to prevent breaking links.
* EMERGENCY: Press 'Esc' at any time to clear the 
  current typing buffer.
